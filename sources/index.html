            <h2>How did we get started?</h2>
            <p>We have such a passion for the city we live in. For over 33 years we have offered tours for Portland visitors and residents alike through our family business. Having family in Portland since the early 1900's has allowed us to build tours out
                of insight over 100 years. We are confident you will love any of our Portland tours with the help of our generous guides. We offer three tours: the Downtown, the Albina, and the Landmarks tour. <br><br>We hope to meet you soon! Let us
                know if you have any questions in the comments area below.<br><br>Thank you!
            </p>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p><i>I moved to Portland a few years ago and learned so much from our tour guide on the history of the African American community in Portland."</i> - Alex<br><br>"It was amazing to walk around downtown Portland comparing the images in the booklet
                to the current building or in some cases disappearance of a building." - Emily<br><br><i>"We were only in town for a day and decided to make the most of it with a tour. We covered almost the entire city. I couldn't have done that alone and our tour guide was so fun!"</i> - Beatrix</p>
